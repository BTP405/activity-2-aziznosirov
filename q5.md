    The first approach uses a list. It appends the values to a list that is then returned.

    The second approach uses list comprehension, which basically allows you to create a list with a shorter syntax.

    The third approach uses a "yield" keyword, which basically yields or in other words returns the value to the caller of the function (i.e "for i in doubleL(5):"), which prints one value, and returns to the loop of the called function to yield the next values in the same way.

The advantage of using generators is that unlike a list for instance, you don't need to store many values at once, which saves memory. That can be useful when dealing with large data sets.
